# Project Euler Pi
The intersection of Project Euler, the Go programming language and the Raspberry Pi.
## Why ?
I bumped into Project Euler (www.projecteuler.net) while I was starting to learn the Go programming language (golang.org). At the time I was looking for some small self-contained projects to write so that I could learn go by doing - so why not use Go to solve the Project Euler problems ?
To add some fun to the mix I decided to try to solve the problems as quickly as possibly using the most efficient techniques. After all, Go is all about speed and concurrency. To make the play field level I needed a fixes piece of hardware which could run Go - enter the Raspnerry Pi.
## What Next ?
The next thing is for me to see if I can keep solving the problems... and measuring the performance of the solutions when running on the Pi. If anyone can improve the performance of any of these solutions submit a pull request or send a patch file to me and I'll add it to the source.
